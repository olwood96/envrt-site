The EU Digital Product Passport (DPP) is set to become one of the most visible indicators of a fashion brand's environmental performance. For apparel and footwear brands selling into the EU market, the DPP is not just a compliance requirement. It is a new way to make product level sustainability data accessible to customers, retailers and regulators through a simple data carrier like a QR code.

The EU has already approved the DPP framework in law via the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). Textiles and apparel have been identified as a top priority product group in the European Commission's 2025–2030 work plan, with a textile specific delegated act planned for adoption in 2027. After that, brands should expect a minimum transition period of at least 18 months, which points to implementation starting from 2028 onward.

At ENVRT, we see a clear message: brands that build product level data foundations early will move faster, reduce cost, and turn transparency into a competitive advantage.

## TL;DR

**What:** The Digital Product Passport creates a digital record for each product, accessed via QR code or similar identifier. Early DPPs are expected to focus on material composition, key manufacturing processes, core environmental indicators, chemical compliance, traceability, and durability attributes.

**Who:** The DPP will apply to fashion brands selling apparel and textiles in the EU, regardless of where the brand is based. The exact scope, including how footwear is handled, will be confirmed in delegated acts.

**When:** ESPR has been approved. Textile specific rules are expected in 2027, followed by a transition period. Practical rollout is expected from 2028 onward.

**How to prepare:** Start by building reliable product data that can support [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](/insights/life-cycle-assessment-guide-for-brands), traceability and reporting so you can "measure once, report everywhere."

## What Is the EU Digital Product Passport for Textiles?

Think of the DPP as a digital fingerprint for a garment. It links a physical product to a structured digital record that can include supply chain information, environmental footprint, material composition, chemical compliance, and circularity characteristics such as recyclability and repairability.

The ESPR sets the framework by introducing product performance requirements and information requirements for goods placed on the EU market. The DPP is the mechanism that makes key product information accessible in a standardised, digital way.

For fashion brands, this is the shift from broad brand level sustainability statements to product level disclosure.

## Which Fashion Brands Will Be Affected?

Under the current ESPR framework, the DPP is intended to apply to apparel and textiles sold in the EU market, regardless of brand size or where the brand is headquartered. The detailed scope, timelines and required data fields will be set out in industry specific delegated acts, which are the technical documents that translate ESPR into enforceable rules for specific product groups.

Footwear is not listed as a first wave priority product group in the same way as textiles, but the EU has signalled its environmental relevance and its potential relationship to eco modulated extended producer responsibility fees. A dedicated study on footwear is expected by the end of 2027 to assess how ecodesign and information requirements could apply.

## DPP Timeline for Fashion Brands

- **June 2024:** ESPR framework approved, including the DPP concept at a high level
- **2025–2030 work plan:** Textiles and apparel identified as a priority product group
- **2027:** Textile delegated act expected to be adopted
- **From 2028 onward:** Likely start of implementation following an expected minimum transition period of 18 months

The key planning insight is simple: products being designed today may be sold during the first compliance window. If your data systems are not operational well before 2028, you risk rushed implementation, data gaps and avoidable cost.

## What Data Will the Digital Product Passport Require?

Fashion already uses physical labels for basics like fibre composition and country of origin. The DPP expands this dramatically with more detailed and more standardised reporting.

A major anchor for environmental reporting is expected to be alignment with the EU Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for apparel and footwear, designed to improve consistency across disclosures.

### What Could Be Included in the DPP?

EU research has outlined a broad set of potential information categories. In practice, you can think about the DPP data model across these themes:

- **Product description:** size, colour, performance, and after sales details such as repair status
- **Composition:** material percentages plus optional material origin and treatments
- **Supply chain and manufacturing:** stages from raw material sourcing through production
- **Transport:** modes and distances by stage to support footprinting and transparency
- **Documentation:** certificates, audit reports, and quality control evidence
- **Environmental impact:** product environmental footprint data for eco design and customer disclosure
- **Chemical and health compliance:** references to compliance obligations such as REACH
- **Circularity and durability:** recycled content, repairability, take back services, recyclability attributes
- **Brand information and communication:** brand commitments, contact details, data carrier type such as QR or NFC
- **Optional lifecycle tracking:** resale, repair, modifications, and end of life handling

Many brands are starting with an initial DPP focused on environmental data, often built on product LCA.

## Which Data Should Fashion Brands Prepare First?

A Commission mandated textile preparatory study published in December 2025 focuses on what is technically feasible and scalable at product level. It suggests early DPP implementations are most likely to prioritise:

- Material composition and weights
- Key manufacturing processes
- Core environmental indicators, especially climate, energy, and water
- Chemical compliance references
- Basic traceability information such as production stages and locations
- Durability, repairability, and recyclability attributes

This supports a phased rollout where essential product and environmental data comes first, then more advanced circularity and lifecycle tracking is added over time.

## How Will the Digital Product Passport Be Displayed?

The DPP is expected to be accessed through a data carrier physically attached to the product at point of sale, typically on a label. That carrier links to a unique product identifier and a digital record stored in a database or website.

Operationally, the DPP is expected to be created at the SKU level, not as a single average across a whole product line and not necessarily per individual item.

The goal is standardised access for consumers, retailers, market surveillance authorities, and other stakeholders.

## What Brands Are Asking for From DPP Solutions

Across apparel and footwear, the same requirements keep appearing:

- **LCA integration:** avoid duplicate data collection by connecting DPP outputs to your existing LCA and reporting workflows
- **Automation:** generate DPPs at scale with minimal manual work
- **Custom branding:** make the passport feel like a premium product experience
- **Traceability depth:** supplier level information, verified origins, certifications
- **Multiple impact indicators:** go beyond CO₂e to include water, energy and additional KPIs

At ENVRT, this is exactly why we focus on fast ingestion, structured product data, and automated outputs that support both compliance and customer facing transparency.

## Why Start Now?

Delays in the policy timeline are not a reason to pause. They are breathing room to build the data foundations properly.

**Avoid rushed implementation:** Supplier data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and spread across PLM, spreadsheets, and emails. Building a DPP ready data infrastructure can take a year or more.

**Design cycle reality:** The collections being developed now can land in market during the first expected DPP compliance window. The data you capture today becomes the basis for future disclosures.

**Luxury and premium upside:** DPPs can strengthen authentication and anti counterfeiting. SKU specific QR codes linked to product specific data are difficult to replicate at scale.

## What a Phased DPP Rollout Could Look Like for Textiles

EU research has proposed a phased approach for textiles:

### Phase 1: Minimal and simplified DPP (short term horizon around 2027)

Focus on essential, high value information such as product composition including recycled content, hazardous substances, and plastic microfibres; recyclability; [supply chain traceability](/insights/supply-chain-intelligence-turning-data-into-action) for key processes such as weaving, dyeing, and finishing; packaging details including recycled content and recyclability; product safety and environmental impact basics; and supporting LCA fields like material weights plus transport modes and distances.

Design principle: keep it simple for consumers and enable interoperability across supply chain systems so data flows without manual re-entry.

### Phase 2: Advanced DPP (mid term horizon around 2030)

Expansion based on Phase 1 learnings: broader lifecycle data coverage, deeper supply chain detail with controlled access for confidential data, richer finished product attributes to support sorting and recycling, and after sales tracking such as repair and second hand activity.

Design principle: standardise data exchange between PLM, supply chain tools, resale platforms, and recyclers.

### Phase 3: Full circular DPP (long term horizon around 2033)

A mature system that supports circularity at scale: end to end supply chain integration with inherited data across tiers, lifecycle tracking through distribution, use, repairs, and end of life, improved sorting and recycling through detailed product design data, and higher closed loop recycling rates through better data exchange.

## How ENVRT Helps Fashion Brands Prepare

Preparing for the EU Digital Product Passport starts with product level data you can trust. That typically means building an LCA ready foundation, mapping supply chain stages, capturing key materials and weights, and structuring evidence and compliance references so you can generate consistent disclosures.

ENVRT is built around the principle of **measure once, report everywhere**, helping fashion brands create the data backbone for DPP readiness while also supporting broader reporting needs.
