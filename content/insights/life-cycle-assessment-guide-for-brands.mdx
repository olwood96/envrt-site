Fashion brands are increasingly being asked to back up sustainability claims with real data. Not vague commitments. Not recycled hang-tags. Actual, documented, evidence-based data. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the methodology that makes that possible.

This guide explains what LCA is, how it works in the context of fashion, and why it matters more now than it ever has.

## What Is a Life Cycle Assessment?

A Life Cycle Assessment is a structured method for quantifying the environmental impacts of a product across its life: from the raw materials used to make it, through to what happens when it's discarded. In fashion, that means tracing a garment from fibre production, through manufacturing, consumer use, and eventual disposal or recovery.

The methodology is governed by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, which set out a consistent framework for how studies should be defined, built, and interpreted. That standardisation is what makes LCA results comparable and credible, and what separates a proper LCA from a back-of-the-envelope carbon estimate.

## The Three Scopes You'll Encounter

LCA studies are often described using the language of scope or system boundaries:

**Cradle to gate** covers everything from raw material extraction up to the point of sale or factory exit. This is the most common scope in fashion because it captures the bulk of a garment's supply chain impacts and is where brands have the most opportunity to intervene.

**Cradle to grave** extends the assessment to include the consumer use phase (washing, drying, ironing) and end-of-life disposal. For some product types, use-phase impacts are significant, though this scope introduces a high degree of variability depending on consumer behaviour and geography.

**Cradle to cradle** is the scope used in circular design models, where materials are recovered and re-enter the system. This approach rewards design decisions that extend a product's useful life or reduce the need for virgin inputs.

Which scope is appropriate depends on what you're trying to answer and, increasingly, what regulations require you to report. At ENVRT, we work cradle to gate. Consumer use and end-of-life phases introduce too much variability in real-world behaviour to produce values that are reliable enough for decision-making or credible external disclosure. The supply chain is where data quality can be controlled, and where the most significant, actionable impacts sit.

## The Four Life Cycle Stages in Apparel

While every study sets its own boundaries, most fashion LCAs are structured around four core stages. The first two sit within the cradle-to-gate scope and are where brands can most directly influence outcomes. The latter two are included here for completeness, as they are part of the broader LCA landscape.

**Fibre and raw material supply.** This covers the cultivation or extraction of fibres (cotton, polyester, viscose, wool, blends) and their initial processing. Agricultural inputs, land use, and early energy demands are all captured here. For natural fibres especially, this stage can be a significant driver of overall impact.

**Material and garment manufacturing.** Spinning, weaving or knitting, dyeing, finishing, sewing, and packaging all fall within this block. For many garments, this is where the largest share of energy use, process chemicals, and wastewater arises. Wet processing in particular, including dyeing and finishing, tends to be a [major hotspot](/insights/sustainability-hotspots-targeting-the-right-stage).

**Consumer use.** How a garment is cared for matters. Washing frequency, water temperature, tumble drying, and ironing all contribute to cumulative environmental impact. However, because consumer behaviour varies so widely across geographies and demographics, use-phase modelling relies heavily on assumptions that are difficult to verify, which is why it falls outside a credible cradle-to-gate scope.

**End of life.** Landfill, incineration, resale, repair, recycling, and repurposing each carry different environmental outcomes. As with the use phase, end-of-life pathways are highly variable and context-dependent, making them difficult to model with the precision required for reliable product-level disclosure.

## How an LCA Is Actually Built: The ISO Process

The ISO framework organises an LCA study into four connected steps. Understanding these steps helps brands engage meaningfully with the process and spot when a study has been done properly versus cut short.

### Step 1: Define the Goal and Scope

Before any data is collected, you establish what you're trying to answer and how the study will be bounded. This includes:

- **Functional unit:** the baseline against which impacts are measured. In fashion, this might be one garment assessed across its production journey.
- **System boundaries:** which processes are included and which are excluded, and why.
- **Assumptions:** expected garment lifespan, transport distances, and any other variables that shape the model.

This stage is where inconsistencies most often creep in. Two brands assessing a similar product can arrive at very different numbers simply because they've framed their studies differently. Transparency here is essential, both for internal decision-making and for any external disclosure.

### Step 2: Build the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)

This is the data collection phase. You're capturing the inputs and outputs at each stage of the product's life: material quantities, energy and fuel use, process chemicals, transport modes and distances, emissions, wastewater, and waste streams.

Inventory quality is usually the limiting factor in fashion. Supplier data can be partial, inconsistent, held across multiple spreadsheets, or simply unavailable at the detail required. Closing these gaps without making assumptions that undermine the results is where a significant part of the effort lives.

### Step 3: Translate the Inventory into Impacts (LCIA)

The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) step converts the raw inventory data into the environmental impact indicators you actually want to measure. This translation happens via an agreed characterisation method. In the EU, the **Environmental Footprint (EF)** approach, used within the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) framework, maps inventory flows across multiple impact categories and is increasingly the reference method for compliance purposes.

### Step 4: Interpret the Results

This is where LCA becomes genuinely useful. Interpretation involves identifying where the biggest impacts sit by stage, process, and material, and then testing how sensitive those results are to changes in key assumptions. What happens if the electricity grid mix at the manufacturing facility improves? What if a supplier switches to a lower-impact dyeing process? Scenario testing like this helps brands focus their reduction efforts where they'll have the greatest effect.

## What a Well-Built LCA Actually Enables

When LCA is implemented properly, not as a one-off exercise but as a repeatable, data-driven asset, it supports a range of concrete decisions and obligations.

**Better material choices.** Comparing fibres, blends, and finishes on consistent boundaries means you're making decisions based on evidence rather than assumption or supplier marketing.

**Targeted manufacturing improvements.** Identifying high-impact processes (dyeing, finishing, energy-intensive steps) lets you direct supplier engagement and investment where it will make the most difference.

**Credible product claims.** Environmental marketing claims that can't be substantiated with documented evidence are increasingly a [regulatory and reputational risk](/insights/green-claims-sustainability-marketing-fashion). LCA provides the underlying evidence that makes claims defensible.

**Regulatory readiness.** The EU [Digital Product Passport (DPP)](/insights/digital-product-passport-textiles-guide) under ESPR, France's environmental labelling requirements, and emerging global equivalents are all moving towards mandatory product-level environmental disclosure. The data foundation needed for these requirements is, in large part, an LCA foundation.

**Progress tracking.** LCA creates a baseline. Without a baseline, sustainability targets are directional at best. With one, you can measure what's actually changing year on year.

## The Regulatory Pressure Is Accelerating

The EU's ESPR regulation and the Digital Product Passport framework will require brands to disclose product-level environmental data in machine-readable form, at scale, across collections. France's affichage environnemental is already in motion. Other markets are watching and following.

These aren't distant requirements. Brands that begin building their LCA data infrastructure now will be positioned to meet them with reliable data. Those that wait will face the familiar combination of missing supplier information, rushed assumptions, and expensive remediation work.

Starting early also means starting better, because the quality of your LCA improves as your supplier data matures.

## How ENVRT Approaches LCA

At ENVRT, LCA is the foundation of the environmental data we generate through ENVRT LAB™. Our methodology is developed in line with ISO 14040 and PEFCR principles, covering climate and water scarcity impact on a cradle-to-gate basis.

We work cradle to gate deliberately. It is the scope where data quality can be controlled, where supply chain impacts are most significant, and where brands have the most direct ability to drive change. Extending beyond the factory gate into consumer use and end-of-life introduces a level of behavioural variability that, in our view, undermines the reliability of the output.

Rather than producing static reports, we focus on building LCA as a repeatable, structured data asset: one that can be updated as supplier data improves, used to support product-level transparency, and scaled across a collection rather than applied product by product.
