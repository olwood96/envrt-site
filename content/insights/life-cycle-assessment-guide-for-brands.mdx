Fashion brands are under growing pressure to back up sustainability claims with real data. **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** is one of the most widely used methodologies for doing exactly that. It measures a product's environmental impacts across its life cycle, then helps brands identify where impacts are highest and what to improve first. It also creates the data foundation for product level transparency, including upcoming requirements like the **EU [Digital Product Passport (DPP)](/insights/digital-product-passport-textiles-guide)** under **ESPR** and national schemes such as **France's environmental labelling**.

At ENVRT, we treat LCA as the engine behind credible environmental metrics. When built on structured product and supply chain data, LCA becomes a repeatable asset that supports reporting, compliance, and customer communication.

## What is a Life Cycle Assessment?

A **Life Cycle Assessment** is a structured way to quantify environmental impacts associated with a product, process, or system. In fashion, that usually means measuring impacts from fibre production through manufacturing, use, and end of life.

LCA is often described using scope terms:

- **Cradle to gate**: from raw materials to the factory gate or point of sale
- **Cradle to grave**: includes consumer use and disposal
- **Cradle to cradle**: supports circular design where materials can be recovered and used again

Instead of focusing on a single metric, LCA can cover several indicators such as **greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂e)**, **energy demand**, and **water related impacts**. The strength of LCA is that it reveals trade offs, for example when a lower carbon choice increases water scarcity risk.

A useful mental model is that LCA is only as reliable as its inputs. Strong methodology plus high quality data produces decision grade outputs.

## The Life Cycle Stages Typically Modelled for Apparel

While every study has its own boundaries, fashion LCAs usually include four core blocks:

### 1) Fibre and raw material supply

This covers cultivation or extraction and early processing of fibres such as cotton, polyester, viscose, wool, and blends.

### 2) Material and garment manufacturing

Spinning, knitting or weaving, dyeing, finishing, sewing, packaging, and related waste streams. For many products, this stage is a major driver of energy use, chemicals, and wastewater.

### 3) Use phase

Consumer behaviour like washing, drying, and ironing. Depending on the garment type and expected number of wears, the use phase can meaningfully change total impacts.

### 4) End of life

Landfill, incineration, recycling, resale, repair, and repurposing. Circular pathways typically reduce overall impact when they extend the useful life of a product or reduce demand for virgin materials.

## The ISO Method: How an LCA Is Built

Most LCAs follow **ISO 14040 and ISO 14044**, which organise the work into four connected steps. These steps matter because they make studies comparable and auditable.

### Step 1: Define the goal and scope

You establish what you are trying to answer and how the study will be framed. This includes:

- **Functional unit**: what impacts are measured against, for example one garment over a set number of wears
- **System boundaries**: which processes are included or excluded
- **Assumptions**: expected lifetime, care instructions, recycling rates, and more

This stage is where many inconsistencies start, so it must be explicit and documented.

### Step 2: Build the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)

This is the data collection stage. You capture inputs and outputs such as material quantities and composition, electricity and fuel use, process chemicals and auxiliaries, transport modes and distances, and emissions, wastewater, and waste.

Inventory quality is often the limiting factor in fashion because supplier data may be partial, inconsistent, or stored across multiple systems.

### Step 3: Translate inventory into impacts (LCIA)

The **Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA)** converts inventory flows into impact indicators using an agreed method. In the EU context, brands often look toward the **Environmental Footprint (EF)** approach used in **Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)** work, which maps inventory data into multiple categories.

### Step 4: Interpret the results

Interpretation is where LCA becomes useful. Brands use it to find [hotspots](/insights/sustainability-hotspots-targeting-the-right-stage) by life cycle stage, process, and material; test sensitivities, for example changes in electricity mix or care behaviour; and compare scenarios and prioritise improvements with the highest leverage.

## What LCA Enables for Fashion Brands

When implemented properly, LCA becomes more than a footprint number. It supports concrete decisions and external disclosures:

- **Material selection**: compare fibres, blends, and finishes on consistent boundaries
- **Manufacturing improvements**: target high impact processes like dyeing, finishing, or energy intensive steps
- **Credible communication**: support product claims, sustainability reports, and retailer data requests
- **Regulatory readiness**: create product level data needed for DPP style disclosures and eco labelling schemes
- **Tracking progress**: set baselines and measure reductions over time

LCA can also help avoid [greenwashing risk](/insights/green-claims-sustainability-marketing-fashion) by ensuring claims are grounded in documented assumptions and evidence.

## Where ENVRT Fits In

A lot of LCA guidance sounds simple until you try to operationalise it across a collection. The bottleneck is rarely the equations. It is the workflow: collecting inputs, normalising supplier data, maintaining evidence, and keeping results reusable.

ENVRT helps fashion brands make LCA scalable by focusing on:

- **Structured data ingestion** for materials, weights, and supply chain stages
- **LCA aligned modelling** that can be updated as supplier data improves
- **Hotspot analysis** that translates outputs into improvement opportunities
- **Multi indicator reporting**, not just CO₂e, so teams can manage trade offs
- **Outputs designed for product level disclosure**, including DPP readiness

This is how brands move toward the "measure once, report everywhere" operating model.

## Why Starting Early Pays Off

Regulations and retailer requirements are moving quickly toward product level proof. Waiting creates the classic last minute scramble: missing supplier data, rushed assumptions, and expensive manual workarounds. Building an LCA foundation now makes future reporting easier, more accurate, and less costly.
