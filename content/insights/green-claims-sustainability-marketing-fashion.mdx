Making strong sustainability claims is not the problem. Fashion brands with genuine environmental performance should be communicating it. The problem is making claims without the infrastructure to back them up. In 2026, the consequences of getting that wrong are no longer limited to reputational risk.

Regulators in both the UK and EU are actively tightening the rules around environmental marketing. The direction of travel is consistent: claims must be specific, accurate, and supported by documentation you can produce when asked. Brands that get this right will communicate with confidence. Those that do not are increasingly exposed.

## What the Regulatory Landscape Actually Looks Like

The legal framework around green claims has shifted meaningfully in the last two years, and it is worth understanding what has actually changed.

In the UK, the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 strengthens consumer law enforcement and raises the consequences of misleading claims. It sits alongside the Competition and Markets Authority's Green Claims Code, which sets out six principles for environmental marketing: claims must be truthful, clear, not omit important information, make fair comparisons, consider the full life cycle of the product, and be substantiated. The CMA has already taken enforcement action against fashion brands under this framework, and the appetite for further action is clear.

In the EU, the Green Claims Directive is progressing through the legislative process and will require brands to substantiate environmental claims with a recognised methodology before they are published, not after. It will also restrict certain claim types, including generic terms like "eco-friendly" and "sustainable", unless they are backed by verified performance data at the product level. Once adopted, non-EU brands selling into EU markets will fall within scope.

These are not marginal developments. They represent a structural shift in how sustainability marketing will need to operate.

## The Most Common Source of Risk

Most greenwashing exposure in fashion does not come from deliberate deception. It comes from a workflow problem: marketing copy is written first, and proof is assembled afterward.

That sequence creates mismatched certificates, unclear scope, and outdated documentation. By the time the claim is published, the evidence file, if it exists at all, may not actually support the specific wording used, for the specific product it is attached to, at the tier of the supply chain it implies.

The more robust approach is to treat the evidence as the starting point. Define what can be proven today, at the product level, with documentation that is current. Then write the claim to match. This does not mean being conservative about what you say. It means being precise about what you say.

## The Claim Types That Attract the Most Scrutiny

Not all sustainability claims carry the same risk. The following types consistently attract the most regulatory and consumer attention, and are worth reviewing in your current communications.

**Absolute environmental claims.** Language like "sustainable", "eco-friendly", "planet positive", or "zero impact" implies broad environmental superiority without defining any boundary. These are the claim types most likely to be restricted under the EU Green Claims Directive and are difficult to defend under the CMA Code. The more credible alternative is a precise, measurable statement tied to a specific attribute of the product: the fibre, the manufacturing process, or a documented reduction in a quantified metric.

**Comparative claims without defined scope.** "More sustainable", "lower impact", or "better for the planet" are interpreted as broad statements of superiority unless you clearly define what improved, which part of the product it applies to, and what it is being compared against. The comparison needs to be like-for-like and the baseline needs to be documented.

**Carbon and climate claims.** "Carbon neutral", "net zero", and "climate positive" attract significant scrutiny because they often rely on accounting choices, particularly the use of offsets, that are difficult to explain at the product level. The EU Green Claims Directive will place significant restrictions on offset-based claims. The more defensible approach is to describe what was measured, what the system boundary was, what the main drivers are, and what evidence supports the inputs. That transparency is both more credible and more durable.

**Recycled content claims.** "Made from recycled materials" or "100% recycled polyester" are often mis-scoped. The claim applies to the main fabric but not to the trims, or to the fibre but not the yarn. Chain of custody documentation needs to support the specific component and percentage being claimed, not just the material category.

**Traceability and sourcing claims.** "Ethically made", "responsibly sourced", and "fully traceable" imply a level of tier coverage and verification that brands often cannot evidence across their full supply base. The more defensible version states the tier coverage and the recency of the evidence: traceable to tier two manufacturing with supplier verification updated in the last twelve months, for example. That specificity is both more honest and more robust.

## What a Defensible Claim Actually Requires

A claim that can withstand scrutiny does not require extensive documentation for its own sake. It requires one thing: the ability to answer clearly when someone asks "can you prove it?"

In practice that means being able to identify the exact product and components the claim applies to, the specific wording used externally, the data inputs and their source, the supporting evidence and its issue date, and who reviewed and approved the claim before it was published.

If assembling that information would take days rather than minutes, the claim process has a gap. The goal is not to reduce the ambition of sustainability communications. It is to ensure the infrastructure keeps pace with them.

## Six Questions to Ask Before Publishing Any Sustainability Claim

Before any environmental claim goes to market, it is worth running through these:

Is the claim specific and measurable, or does it make a general impression of superiority? Does the evidence actually cover this product and component, or is it a broader category certificate? Is the documentation current, or has it expired or been superseded? Does the claim imply more scope than the evidence supports, for example tier coverage you do not have? Could you retrieve the supporting evidence quickly if asked? And finally, could someone outside the sustainability team understand what the claim means and what it is based on?

A "no" to any of these is a signal to revise the claim or the evidence before publishing.

## How ENVRT Supports Credible Claims

The infrastructure that makes green claims defensible is the same infrastructure that makes sustainability reporting reliable: product-level data, linked evidence, and outputs that can be retrieved and explained quickly.

ENVRT LAB™ generates climate impact (CO₂e), water scarcity impact, and a transparency score at the product level, on a cradle-to-gate basis and aligned with ISO 14040 and PEFCR methodology. That means environmental claims can be grounded in assessed, documented product data rather than category averages or supplier declarations taken at face value. The transparency score in particular gives brands a single, communicable metric that reflects how much of the product's [supply chain](/insights/supply-chain-intelligence-turning-data-into-action) is evidenced, giving consumers and retailers meaningful information without requiring them to interpret a full [LCA](/insights/life-cycle-assessment-guide-for-brands).

The result is claims that are specific, evidence-backed, and connected to a retrievable data source. That is what credible sustainability marketing looks like in 2026, and it is where the brands with the strongest long-term positions are heading.
