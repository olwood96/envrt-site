Sustainability marketing in fashion is changing fast. In 2026 the risk is not only reputational. It is operational and legal. Brands are being challenged on vague language, weak evidence, selective storytelling and claims that cannot be substantiated consistently across products.

This is where many teams get stuck: marketing needs speed, sustainability needs accuracy, legal needs defensibility and the supply chain rarely provides perfect information on demand. The practical answer is simple: make claims **product level**, **evidence backed** and **easy to retrieve**.

## Why green claims are getting riskier in 2026

Most brands are still relying on supplier emails, certificates stored in shared drives and one off audits. That can work for a single campaign. It breaks when you scale to hundreds of styles across regions and seasons.

Scrutiny is also tightening in the UK. The **Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024** strengthens consumer law enforcement and increases the consequences of misleading claims. The UK government has also published guidance on making green claims across the supply chain, intended to be read alongside the CMA's Green Claims Code. The direction of travel is clear: claims must be specific and supported by documentation you can produce quickly.

## The common mistake: claims written before proof exists

Most greenwashing risk comes from one workflow error: copy is written first, then teams scramble to backfill proof. That leads to mismatched certificates, unclear scope and outdated documentation.

A safer workflow is:

- Define the claim type
- Define the proof threshold
- Verify scope and recency
- Approve language
- Store a claim file

If you cannot assemble a claim file quickly, the claim is high risk.

## The highest risk claim types in fashion

### Absolute environmental claims

Examples: "Sustainable", "Eco friendly", "Planet positive", "Zero impact"

Why risky: they imply broad superiority with no boundary.

Better approach: replace with precise, measurable statements tied to the product.

### "Better" language without a defined scope

Examples: "Low impact", "More sustainable", "Better for the planet"

Why risky: "better" is interpreted broadly unless you define what improved, for what part of the product and based on what evidence.

Better approach: describe the specific attribute, component or documented change.

### Carbon and climate claims

Examples: "Carbon neutral", "Net zero product", "Climate positive"

Why risky: they attract heavy scrutiny and often rely on accounting choices that are difficult to explain clearly at product level.

Better approach: focus on what you measured, the boundary, the key drivers and the evidence supporting inputs.

### Recycled content claims

Examples: "Made from recycled materials", "100% recycled polyester"

Why risky: claims are often mis-scoped, for example main fabric vs whole garment, missing trims, unclear chain of custody.

Better approach: state the component and percentage, link to the relevant documentation.

### Traceability and sourcing claims

Examples: "Ethically made", "Responsibly sourced", "Fully traceable"

Why risky: they can imply tier coverage you do not have.

Better approach: state tier coverage and evidence recency, for example traceable to Tier 2 with evidence updated in the last 12 months.

## What a verified claim actually needs

A defensible claim should have a simple claim file:

- Product identifier and scope (style, season, materials, suppliers)
- The exact claim wording used externally
- The data inputs and source
- Evidence documents (certificates, audits, test results, transaction documents, declarations)
- Validity and recency (issue date, expiry date, versioning)
- Approval record (who reviewed it and when)
- A plain language explanation you could share if challenged

The goal is not paperwork for its own sake. It is speed and confidence when someone asks, "Can you prove it?"

## Six checks before publishing any sustainability claim

1. **Specificity:** is the claim measurable or defined
2. **Product match:** does the evidence cover this style and component
3. **Recency:** is the documentation current
4. **Scope:** are you claiming more than the evidence supports
5. **Retrievability:** can you produce the claim file quickly
6. **Clarity:** can a non expert understand it

## Where ENVRT fits

ENVRT helps brands manage claims in a practical way: product level records, linked evidence, recency tracking and audit ready claim files. It is less about "better marketing" and more about reducing risk and rework by keeping claims and proof connected.

## A simple next step

Start by removing broad claims that you cannot substantiate at product level. Replace them with precise statements you can evidence today, then build a lightweight claim file process so your team can publish confidently across the full range.
