Getting hotspot analysis wrong does not just mean missing an emissions reduction opportunity. It means directing budget, supplier conversations, and internal resource toward initiatives that look credible on a slide but do not meaningfully move the needle. In fashion, that happens more often than most brands would like to admit.

This guide explains what hotspot analysis should look like, where it most commonly goes wrong, and how to refocus on the changes that actually reduce impact across your supply chain.

## What Is a Sustainability Hotspot?

A hotspot is the life cycle stage, process, or material that contributes the largest share of environmental impact for a product. Identifying it correctly is the difference between meaningful action and expensive activity that achieves very little.

In fashion, the biggest hotspots tend to cluster in a few areas: fibre production and raw material processing, energy-intensive manufacturing steps, and wet processing, which covers dyeing, finishing, and related chemical treatments. Transport also features in the conversation, though often with more weight than the data justifies.

The challenge is that hotspots are not universal. They shift depending on fibre mix, fabric weight, production geography, and the scope of the assessment. A hotspot for one product can look very different for another, even within the same collection.

## The Most Common Hotspot Mistakes

### Relying too heavily on averages

Industry datasets and category averages are a useful starting point, but they become a liability when treated as product-specific truth. Small changes in fibre blend, fabric weight, or manufacturing location can shift where the biggest impacts sit, sometimes significantly.

The fix is straightforward: start with actual product composition and weight data, then tighten assumptions at the stages where impacts are highest. Averages are a baseline, not an answer.

### Inconsistent system boundaries

Hotspots change depending on what is included in an assessment. If one product includes the use phase and another excludes it, any comparison between them is meaningless. If wet processing is left out because supplier data is missing, the largest impact driver can disappear entirely from the results, and the resulting analysis will point teams in the wrong direction.

Boundaries need to be consistent across products and documented clearly so that everyone working with the data is operating from the same frame of reference.

### Overweighting transport

Transport is visible, intuitive, and easy to discuss in a boardroom. It is also, for the majority of garments, not where the biggest impacts sit. Air freight can be significant when it is used, but for most products the dominant drivers are materials and manufacturing energy, not how the finished garment moves between factory and distribution centre.

Model transport realistically and prioritise it only if the data confirms it as a major contributor. If it is being treated as the primary lever without that confirmation, the analysis has probably been steered by what is easy to measure rather than what actually matters.

### Missing the water scarcity dimension

Most hotspot discussions in fashion default to carbon and energy. But for many garments, particularly those involving significant wet processing, water scarcity impact is just as important and in some supply chain geographies, potentially more so.

Dyeing and finishing processes are among the most water-intensive stages in apparel manufacturing. Ignoring water scarcity when assessing these processes gives an incomplete picture of where the real environmental burden lies, and where the real opportunity for improvement sits.

## Hotspot Analysis as a Business Tool, Not Just a Sustainability Exercise

This is where the conversation often gets more interesting. Sustainability hotspots and operational inefficiencies tend to overlap, which means targeting the right stage frequently reduces costs as well as impacts.

Brands that get this right often find that efficiency improvements in heat, steam, and electricity-intensive processes reduce energy spend directly. More accurate product specifications cut unnecessary material weight and trim costs. Better transport planning eliminates the expedited shipments that are driven by planning failures rather than genuine commercial need. And concentrating data collection and compliance evidence on the stages that matter most reduces the overhead of the process itself.

The key is prioritisation. Chasing a low-impact lever not only fails to move environmental metrics. It consumes time and money that could have gone toward changes that do.

## How to Prioritise the Right Actions

Once hotspots are correctly identified, prioritisation becomes a much more straightforward exercise. The most useful framework is to evaluate potential interventions across three dimensions: how large the likely impact reduction is, how much influence the brand has over that stage within existing supplier relationships, and how quickly the change can realistically be implemented.

The highest-leverage areas in fashion tend to be wet processing efficiency, reducing unnecessary material weight, improving product durability and care outcomes, and eliminating air freight where it is not genuinely required. These are not always the most visible initiatives, but they are consistently where the evidence points.

## A Quick Diagnostic: Are You Targeting the Right Hotspot?

If any of the following are true, the analysis may be pointing you in the wrong direction:

- Wet processing is absent from the model or treated as a generic placeholder
- Transport is the primary focus without confirmation from the underlying data
- Product weights and fibre compositions are estimated rather than verified
- System boundaries differ across the products you are comparing
- Water scarcity has not been assessed alongside climate impact

Any one of these can skew results enough to redirect priorities away from the stages where meaningful reductions are achievable.

## How ENVRT Approaches Hotspot Analysis

At ENVRT, hotspot identification is built into the output of every assessment run through ENVRT LAB™. Rather than presenting a single footprint number, ENVRT generates climate impact (CO₂e) and water scarcity impact at the product level on a cradle-to-gate basis, giving brands a clear view of where impacts are largest across both dimensions.

That dual-indicator approach matters precisely because the hotspot for carbon and the hotspot for water are not always the same stage. Seeing both together allows brands to make better-informed decisions about where to focus, rather than optimising one metric at the expense of the other.
