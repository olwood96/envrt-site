Most fashion brands talk about "hotspots" but many end up optimising the wrong thing. The issue is rarely ambition. It is usually **how hotspots are calculated and interpreted**. When assumptions, boundaries, or missing data skew the picture, teams prioritise initiatives that look sensible but do not meaningfully reduce impact.

This guide explains the most common hotspot mistakes in fashion [LCA](/insights/life-cycle-assessment-guide-for-brands) and how to refocus on actions that genuinely help reduce garment emissions and support decarbonisation across the fashion supply chain.

## What a hotspot actually is

A **hotspot** is the life cycle stage, process, or material that contributes the largest share of environmental impacts for a product. In fashion, hotspots commonly sit in:

- Materials and fibre production
- Energy intensive manufacturing steps
- Wet processing like dyeing and finishing
- Convoluted transport routes

## The hotspot mistakes that push brands off track

### 1) Over relying on averages

Industry datasets and category averages are useful for a baseline, but they can mislead when treated as product truth. Small changes in fibre mix, fabric weight, or production geography can shift hotspots significantly.

**What to do instead:** start with product specific composition and weight, then tighten assumptions where impacts are highest.

### 2) Wrong or inconsistent boundaries

Hotspots change depending on what is included. If one assessment includes use phase and another excludes it, comparisons break. If wet processing is left out due to missing inputs, the largest driver can disappear entirely.

**What to do instead:** keep boundaries consistent across products and document key assumptions so teams are working from the same frame.

### 3) Transport gets too much attention

Transport is visible and easy to discuss, so it is often treated as the main lever. Air freight can be significant, but for many garments the bigger drivers are materials and manufacturing energy.

**What to do instead:** model transport realistically and prioritise it only if it is confirmed as a major share, particularly where air freight is used.

## Hotspot analysis can reduce costs, not just emissions

Hotspot analysis is often framed as a sustainability exercise, but it can also support cost reduction because hotspots frequently overlap with operational inefficiencies.

When you target the right stage, brands can often uncover:

- **Lower energy spend** through efficiency improvements in heat, steam, and electricity intensive processes
- **Material savings** from cutting unnecessary weight, trims, or over engineered specifications
- **Efficient transport routes** cutting costs and increasing efficiency by reducing distances and eliminating redundant supply chain routes
- **Fewer expedited shipments** by addressing planning issues that trigger air freight
- **Reduced compliance overhead** by focusing data collection and evidence on the few stages that matter most

The key is prioritisation. If you chase a low impact lever, you often spend money and time without seeing meaningful outcomes.

## How to prioritise the right actions

Once hotspots are interpreted correctly, prioritisation becomes straightforward. Focus on changes that score well on:

- **Impact leverage:** likely reduction size
- **Feasibility:** ability to influence within supplier relationships
- **Speed:** time to implement within a season or year

Common high leverage areas include wet processing efficiency, reducing unnecessary material weight, improving durability and care outcomes, eliminating air freight and removing redundant transport routes.

## Quick check: are you chasing the wrong hotspot?

If any of these are true, your priorities may be distorted:

- Wet processing is missing or treated as a generic placeholder
- Transport is treated as the main lever without checking modes and routes
- Product weights and fibre mixes are not accurate
- Boundaries differ across products you are comparing

## Bottom line

Hotspot analysis only drives real progress when it reflects reality. The biggest wins usually come from **materials, wet processing, and energy**, not the most visible story. Validate the stage first, then optimise what actually moves the needle.
